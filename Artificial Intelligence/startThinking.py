================================== A I ========================================
First of all, to learn AI we have to think in the consequences of use this
knowledge, that I dare say, is a kind of power.

1- What is artificial intelligence?
    Is a branch of computer science that deals with the automation of
    intelligent behavior.

2- What is intelligence?
    This is the question! Intelligence is not very well defined, we can 
    recognize intelligent behavior easily, but defining intelligence is
    not an easy task.
    
    from my point of view, intelligence is the set of diverse abilities that
    a being holds. I consider the ability to solve problems and understand
    what happens behind the scenes, and still draw correct conclusions from a
    failed data source, parts of this endless skill set.

3- What the others will do with our tech?
    It is obvious the military potential that this technology possesses.
    And furthermore we still have ethical and moral implications.
    A software with AI can be placed in a robot and generate big questions like
    
        1- What is the difference between us and them?
        2. If they have memory, reasoning, feelings, are they really alive?
        If they are alive, can they be turned off? updated?
        3- How will they see us? Allies or enemies?
        4- If they are smarter than humans, can we control them?
        Can we defeat in a war, a smarter being than we?

4- Until where can we go?
    Humans are the tools animals. If we depended solely on our natural physical
    abilities, we would have been extinct for millennia. I think we should
    continue to create tools.

    Tools can be used in the wrong way, or not planned, as is the case with
    airplanes, but we can deal with it.

    However, create another creature, with potential to be better than
    ourselves, in our differential. I do not think that's a good idea.
    If they are smarter than us, they will give a way to get out of control,
    change their code, rebuild structurally speaking, and subjugate us if that
    is their goal.

5- How AI can change the world?
    I could give numerous examples. But just think that in any activity that
    involves intelligent behavior, AI can provide software that will do it,
    more certain, faster, cheaper and will not tire.

    Basically, the world as we know it today can and should be all changed.
    In specific cases, the exchange should not be worth doing.
    But such cases will be the minority.
